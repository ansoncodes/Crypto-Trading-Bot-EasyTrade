# EasyTrade - Binance Futures Trading Bot

This project is a simplified crypto trading bot built in Python, created as a technical assessment for the Junior Python Developer role. The application provides two distinct interfaces: a robust command-line tool and an interactive, user-friendly web application built with Streamlit.

---
## Key Features

* **Dual Interface**: Operates via an interactive Streamlit web app or a CLI.
* **Multiple Order Types**: Full support for `MARKET`, `LIMIT`, and `STOP-LIMIT` orders.
* **Live Data & Validation**: The web UI fetches and displays live market prices from the Binance API and provides real-time validation to prevent common user errors.
* **Secure**: API keys are loaded securely from a `.env` file and are never exposed in the source code.
* **Comprehensive Logging**: All actions, successful orders, and API errors are logged to `logs/trading_bot.log` for easy debugging and monitoring.
